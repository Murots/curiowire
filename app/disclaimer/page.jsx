        <Paragraph>
          <strong>CurioWire</strong> is an experimental digital publication
          built on automated tools, open data, and artificial intelligence.
          While every effort is made to ensure factual alignment and narrative
          clarity, content is generated or refined using algorithmic models and
          may not always represent verified or up-to-date information.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionTitle>1. Nature of the Content</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          Articles, images, and headlines published on CurioWire are composed
          with the assistance of machine learning systems. These systems
          summarize, reinterpret, and occasionally fictionalize fragments of
          data, language, and imagery. As a result, some stories may contain
          inaccuracies, omissions, or artistic representations that do not
          perfectly reflect real-world events.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Readers should treat all content as informational and exploratory, not
          as definitive reporting or professional advice.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionTitle>2. Expression and Tone</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          The tone and language of each article are designed to evoke a
          twentieth-century editorial aesthetic ‚Äî occasionally ironic, poetic,
          or dramatic. Such expression is stylistic, not ideological. Any
          opinions, implications, or interpretations expressed within the
          content are generated by algorithms and do not represent the beliefs
          or positions of CurioWire, its editors, or contributors.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionTitle>3. Imagery and Representation</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          Visual content generated or selected by AI is intended to complement
          the narrative and theme of each article. These images should not be
          interpreted as literal or documentary evidence of the subjects
          depicted. Variations in realism, likeness, or historical accuracy are
          inherent to the creative process.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionTitle>4. Responsibility and Liability</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          CurioWire assumes no responsibility for decisions made or opinions
          formed based on the information provided on this site. We do not
          warrant the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of any material for
          specific purposes. External links are provided for context and
          convenience only ‚Äî CurioWire is not responsible for the content or
          policies of third-party sites.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionTitle>5. Ethical and Cultural Sensitivity</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          Given the automated nature of our editorial process, some phrasing or
          associations may unintentionally appear insensitive or controversial.
          Such occurrences are never deliberate. We welcome thoughtful feedback
          and continuously refine our models to avoid harm, bias, or
          misrepresentation.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          For feedback, factual corrections, or ethical concerns, readers may
          reach out via our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Constructive
          dialogue helps improve both our editorial process and technological
          transparency.
