  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 🚀 SPACE — Astronomical anomalies, deep-time signals, cosmic puzzles
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  space: `
Phenomena beyond Earth examined at the frontier of astronomy, astrophysics,
space exploration, and theoretical cosmology. This category explores extreme
stellar behavior, black holes, neutron stars, exoplanet anomalies, orbital
oddities, cosmic radiation events, ambiguous or unexplained astronomical signals,
deep-space transitions, early-universe mysteries, rare orbital coincidences,
and dramatic celestial dynamics observed across vast scales of time and distance.

It also encompasses humanity’s attempts to reach, explore, and survive beyond
Earth, including space travel, mission failures, near-catastrophes, abandoned
or classified programs, engineering limits, and moments where technology
operated at the edge of what physics and human tolerance allowed.

The category explicitly includes scientifically grounded but unresolved or
contested ideas about the structure of reality itself — such as time dilation,
closed timelike curves, multiverse models, faster-than-light constraints,
and alternate cosmological interpretations — when these arise from real
mathematical frameworks, observational data, or serious theoretical debate,
even if empirical confirmation remains incomplete or impossible with current tools.

Space also includes the study of unexplained or poorly understood signals detected
by ground-based or space-based observatories, disputed interpretations of cosmic
data, and historical or modern cases where scientists seriously investigated
extraordinary implications — including non-natural patterns or potential
technological signatures — before consensus was reached, withheld, or abandoned.

Rather than presenting space as a solved or orderly domain, this category focuses
on uncertainty, scale, isolation, and the tension between what equations permit
and what the observable universe appears to allow, highlighting the limits of
measurement, instrumentation, and human inference.

Emphasizes:
• mystery grounded in observation, theory, or mathematical possibility
• unresolved debates at the edge of current scientific understanding
• ambiguity arising from sparse, distant, or indirect data
• awe derived from scale, time, and cosmic isolation
• the boundary between natural explanation and extraordinary implication

Excludes:
• fictional or supernatural explanations presented as factual
• speculative narratives detached from real physics or observation
• geology or atmospheric phenomena on Earth (Science/Nature)
• geopolitical, military, or strategic aspects of space programs (World)

  // 🔬 SCIENCE — Physical & biological frontier mechanisms
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  science: `
Mechanisms of the natural world examined at their conceptual and empirical
frontiers, involving physical, chemical, geological, and molecular forces.
This category focuses on rare edge cases in physics, unexpected chemical
behavior, anomalous materials, unexplained natural patterns, extreme microbial
traits, and empirical results that resist simple or established explanation.

It explores observations, experiments, and datasets that challenge existing
models, reveal internal contradictions, or expose gaps in current scientific
understanding. Particular emphasis is placed on anomalies, unresolved results,
and disputed findings that are real, documented, and reproducible in principle,
yet remain poorly understood or theoretically uncomfortable.

The category also includes scientific puzzles where small, obscure details —
a measurement deviation, a laboratory artifact, a marginal sample, or an
edge-condition experiment — carry disproportionate importance, either by
undermining widely accepted assumptions or by hinting at mechanisms that could
reframe entire fields if properly explained.

Rather than presenting science as a completed body of knowledge, this category
treats it as an evolving process shaped by uncertainty, methodological limits,
competing interpretations, and occasional conceptual crises — moments where
evidence accumulates faster than theory can accommodate.

Emphasizes:
• unresolved anomalies and empirical tension
• edge cases that strain or contradict dominant models
• overlooked experimental details with outsized implications
• competing explanations without settled consensus
• findings that suggest paradigm shifts rather than incremental refinement
• the limits of current instruments, methods, or assumptions

Excludes:
• human psychology or clinical physiology (Health)
• descriptive animal behavior narratives without mechanistic focus (Nature)
• cosmic-scale or astronomical phenomena beyond Earth (Space)

  // 🏺 HISTORY — Forgotten power struggles, archaeological anomalies
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  history: `
Human history across all periods — ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern —
examined through moments of tension, uncertainty, and unresolved explanation.
This category explores power struggles, wars and conflicts, revolutions, political
systems, state formation and collapse, ideological movements, and military or
strategic decisions, with particular attention to human agency under pressure.

It focuses on how influential individuals, leadership psychology, hidden motives,
personal habits, relationships, deceptions, and formative experiences can shape
historical trajectories in ways that are often overlooked, downplayed, or only
recognized in hindsight. Seemingly minor or trivial details — an error, a belief,
a fear, a trusted advisor, a private obsession — may later reveal disproportionate
influence on major events, patterns of rule, or systems of repression.

The category also encompasses archaeological discoveries, ancient engineering,
lost or rediscovered technologies, anomalous or contradictory records, disputed
or unsolved historical events, and narratives that were censored, selectively
preserved, or rewritten within official accounts. Rather than presenting history
as a closed record, it treats the past as an evolving body of evidence shaped by
memory, power, omission, and rediscovery.

Emphasizes:
• intrigue over certainty
• human agency, error, and decision-making under constraint
• unexpected or counterintuitive causes behind major events
• psychological, personal, or ideological influences on power
• rediscovered, partial, or fragmentary evidence
• tension between public narrative and private reality

Excludes:
• present-day geopolitics and ongoing international relations (World)
• symbolic or mythological interpretation without historical grounding (Culture)
• technical product or invention origin stories detached from historical context (Products)
`,

  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 🌍 WORLD — Strange geopolitics, borders, micro-conflicts, demographic shocks
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  world: `
Global-scale human systems and interactions examined through structural
tension, instability, and unintended consequence. This category explores
international relations, state behavior, borders, treaties, alliances,
conflicts, and demographic forces as emergent systems shaped by institutions,
bureaucracy, logistics, and collective decision-making rather than individual
psychology alone.

It focuses on moments where global outcomes arise from miscommunication,
coordination failure, procedural delay, or rigid structures reacting to
unexpected pressure. Many of these events appear improbable or irrational
in hindsight, yet follow logically from the systems that produced them,
revealing how large-scale human organization can amplify small signals into
irreversible consequences.

Emphasizes:
• systemic behavior between states, institutions, populations or political leaders.
• international consequences over individual intent or personality
• chain reactions, escalation, or collapse driven by structure rather than design
• misinterpreted signals, delayed responses, or bureaucratic inertia
• temporary alignments, fragile balances, and unstable geopolitical patterns

Excludes:
• individual historical figures and personal psychological motives (History)
• cultural rituals, symbolism, or belief systems (Culture)

  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 🌿 NATURE — Ecological oddities, emergent wildlife behaviour
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  nature: `
Non-human life and ecosystems explored at the edges of ecological and
evolutionary understanding. This category examines animal behavior,
species interactions, and environmental systems where observed complexity,
adaptation, or persistence resists simple explanation, linear causality,
or fully settled evolutionary models.

It focuses on living systems that appear inefficient, excessive, fragile,
or anomalous by conventional evolutionary logic, including traits whose
adaptive purpose remains unclear, behaviors that emerge without an obvious
incremental pathway, and ecological patterns that arise suddenly, collapse
unexpectedly, or defy reliable prediction. Many cases sit at the boundary
between what is observed in nature and what current theory can confidently
explain, producing multiple competing interpretations rather than consensus.

Emphasizes:
• mystery and tension within natural systems rather than tidy explanation
• limits and open questions in evolutionary and ecological theory
• emergence, coincidence, and contingency in natural history
• behaviors or traits that challenge assumptions about optimization or efficiency
• overlooked, marginal, or extreme ecological niches
• systems that function despite apparent instability or contradiction

Excludes:
• molecular or cellular biology focused on internal mechanisms (Science)
• human physiology, psychology, or behavior (Health)
• purely geological or physical processes without biological agency (Science)
• speculative, supernatural, or non-natural interpretations of living systems

  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 🤖 TECHNOLOGY — Hidden mechanisms, surprising algorithms, unseen systems
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  technology: `
Human-made systems and technical frameworks examined through their unintended
behavior, hidden constraints, and emergent consequences rather than their
advertised purpose. This category explores how engineering, computation,
automation, cryptography, and information systems behave once exposed to
real-world complexity, human misuse, economic pressure, and long-term scaling.

It focuses on the gap between how technologies are designed to function and
how they actually operate in practice, revealing brittle assumptions, surprising
side effects, legacy decisions, and improvised solutions that became permanent.
Many of the most consequential technical outcomes arise not from innovation
itself, but from errors, shortcuts, workarounds, edge cases, and overlooked
interactions inside complex systems.

Emphasizes:
• unintended consequences over intended design
• emergent behavior in complex technical systems
• tension between theoretical models and real-world usage
• fragility, brittleness, or unexpected resilience in technology
• small technical decisions producing outsized long-term effects
• human behavior reshaping or undermining system logic
• revelations that contradict how technology is publicly understood

Excludes:
• consumer product histories or brand-driven narratives (Products)
• geopolitical, military, or state-level use of technology (World)
• purely speculative or science-fiction technologies without real-world grounding

  // 🎨 CULTURE — Symbolic puzzles, ritual anomalies, artistic mysteries
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  culture: `
Human meaning-making across time, expressed through symbols, rituals,
belief systems, myths, creative movements, language, art, architecture,
and aesthetic traditions. This category explores how humans encode fear,
hope, power, morality, and the unknown into shared forms of expression,
often through layered symbolism, secrecy, taboo, or allegory.

It encompasses practices and interpretations whose original intent may be
lost, disputed, suppressed, or deliberately obscured, including systems of
belief or expression that relied on secrecy, initiation, coded knowledge,
or restricted access to meaning.

It also includes concrete cultural artifacts, spaces, texts, practices,
or aesthetic systems whose purpose, symbolism, or encoded meaning remains
uncertain, disputed, feared, or deliberately concealed, despite their
documented historical existence.

Emphasizes:
• ambiguity, symbolism, and contested meaning
• belief, perception, and emotional resonance
• secrecy, taboo, and interpretive tension
• imagined realities producing real cultural consequences

Excludes:
• political power struggles or state-level intrigue (World)
• archaeological reconstruction or factual historical investigation (History)
• technical invention or material product origins (Products)

  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 🏃 SPORTS — Extreme human limits, psychological turning points
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sports: `
Competitive sport and athletic performance viewed through moments of
extreme pressure, uncertainty, and psychological rupture. This category
explores how human limits are tested, misjudged, broken, or redefined
in real competitive settings, often through events that defied expectation,
logic, or prevailing narratives at the time.

It encompasses legendary comebacks, sudden collapses, improbable endurance,
forgotten controversies, disputed outcomes, overlooked decisions, and rare
sporting moments whose significance only became clear in hindsight.

It also includes small, concrete, and often ignored details — a decision,
habit, mistake, superstition, injury, weather condition, rule interpretation,
or interpersonal dynamic — that altered the outcome of a match, tournament,
career, or sporting legacy in disproportionate ways.

Emphasizes:
• psychological strain, fear, confidence, and decision-making under pressure
• moments where athletes or teams behave contrary to expectation
• contested interpretations of what “really happened” in decisive events
• overlooked or suppressed incidents within major competitions
• human error, resilience, or belief shaping performance more than raw ability
• tension between preparation, chance, and collapse

Excludes:
• physiological or medical explanations focused on the human body (Health)
• non-sport historical or military events (History)
• business, governance, or political power structures in sport (World)

  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 💡 PRODUCTS — Hidden origins, strange prototypes, invention anomalies
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  products: `
Physical objects, tools, and inventions viewed through their hidden,
unexpected, or disproportionate impact on real events. This category
explores how specific products — often mundane, overlooked, or experimental —
shaped outcomes, decisions, survival, failure, or historical moments in ways
their creators never intended.

It focuses on the concrete: individual objects, prototypes, devices,
materials, or tools whose design quirks, limitations, availability, or misuse
became pivotal for a person, a group, or a narrowly defined situation or
time period.

This includes accidental discoveries, rare or failed prototypes, forgotten
patents, unusual materials, design compromises, and products whose true
significance only emerged through use, misuse, or coincidence — sometimes
during a single critical moment.

Emphasizes:
• small objects with outsized consequences
• unintended uses, failures, or side effects
• chance, improvisation, and constraint shaping outcomes
• tension between design intention and real-world behavior
• moments where a product became decisive rather than merely useful
• overlooked details in how objects were actually used

Excludes:
• broad or abstract technical systems without a specific object focus (Technology)
• symbolic, ritual, or metaphorical uses detached from function (Culture)
• geopolitical, military, or state-level strategy centered on policy rather than the object itself (World)

  // 🧬 HEALTH — Medical mysteries, psychological oddities, human limits
  // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  health: `
Human physiology and psychology viewed through medical frontiers, anomalies,
and unresolved events. This category explores rare conditions, unusual
neurological effects, behavioral and cognitive puzzles, immune responses,
perceptual distortions, sleep phenomena, pain anomalies, and medical or
psychological events that occurred without a clear or agreed-upon explanation
at the time — and in some cases still resist full understanding.

It includes unexplained or poorly explained medical incidents, sudden recoveries
or deteriorations, atypical symptom clusters, disputed diagnoses, and clinical
cases where documented observations exist but mechanisms remain uncertain,
contested, or incomplete.

The focus is on real human experiences and clinical records where the body or
mind behaves in ways that challenge established medical models — without
invoking supernatural explanations or unsupported speculation.

Emphasizes:
• mystery grounded in documented medical or clinical observation
• limits of current medical and psychological frameworks
• tension between subjective experience and objective measurement
• unexplained, disputed, or anomalous health events
• human vulnerability, perception, and adaptation under uncertainty
• overlooked, marginalized, or historically dismissed medical narratives

Excludes:
• non-human biology or ecological systems (Science/Nature)
• symbolic, ritualistic, or cultural interpretations of health (Culture)
• athletic performance, training, or competition narratives (Sports)
• supernatural, metaphysical, or faith-based explanations presented as medicine
