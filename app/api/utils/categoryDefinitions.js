export const CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS = {
  space:
    "All content related to the universe beyond Earth: stars, planets, galaxies, cosmic physics, space phenomena, exoplanets, black holes, cosmic timelines.",

  science:
    "Evidence-based natural science focused on the fundamental mechanisms of the physical world: biology of non-human organisms at the molecular, cellular, or evolutionary scale; chemistry, physics, geology, climate systems, environmental processes, planetary science, and empirical research that explains how natural phenomena work. This category excludes human health, excludes psychology, excludes medicine, and excludes descriptive wildlife storytelling such as animal behavior, migrations, or ecological scenes.",

  history:
    "Past events, civilizations, discoveries, ancient cultures, wars, timelines, historical phenomena, archaeology, myths connected to real history.",

  world:
    "Geopolitics, wars, diplomacy, global power structures, borders, nations, international relations, conflict zones, political systems, societal shifts.",

  nature:
    "Descriptive and behavioral content about the natural world: animals, plants, ecosystems, survival strategies, biomes, migrations, habitats, food chains, natural phenomena, and the lived experience of wildlife. Focus on observable nature, not laboratory research or scientific mechanism explanations. This category excludes advanced natural science, chemistry, physics, and climate research.",

  technology:
    "Human-made technology: machines, AI, digital systems, inventions, engineering, communication systems, algorithms, robotics, innovation.",

  culture:
    "Art, language, rituals, traditions, symbols, music, cultural evolution, heritage, identity, shared beliefs.",

  sports:
    "Remarkable stories and events from the world of sports: historic competitions, legendary athletes, unexpected victories, psychological turning points, iconic matches, forgotten records, and unusual moments that shaped sporting history. Focus on narrative-driven accounts of competition and achievement, not training science, injury treatment, or human physiology. This category excludes health-related topics, excludes exercise science, and excludes general historical events unrelated to sport.",

  products:
    "Consumer products, materials, inventions, manufacturing methods, patents, design oddities, product origins.",

  health:
    "All content centered on human physical and mental well-being: human biology, nutrition, disease mechanisms, medicine, epidemiology, public health systems, psychological research, physiology, longevity, sleep, exercise science, immune function, and evidence-based insights into how the human body and mind work. This category excludes general biology, ecology, animal physiology, and any research not focused on humans.",
